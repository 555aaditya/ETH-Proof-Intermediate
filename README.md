# Smart Contract for Handling Errors
This is a Smart Contract written in Solidity which has three differerent functions which handle error using 
`require()`, `revert()` and `assert()` functions

## Requirements to run the program 
Solidity ^0.8.18 and Remix IDE

## Functions of the Contract
The `errorHandling` smart contract has the following functions present

### `testAsert(address _z)`
* It demonstrates the usage of `assert` function
* It takes an address `_z` as the parameter
* It tests if the global variable `msg.sender` is equal to the address_`_z`
* If it is `true` it then returns the address `_z`

### `testRevert(uint _x)`
* It demonstrates the usage of `revert` function
* It takes an unsigned integer `_x` as the parameter
* It checks if the value of `_x` is greater than 10
* If it is `true`it goes ahead and returns the value of `_x`
* If it is `false` it reverts the function with the statement 'enter a value greater than 10'

### `testRequire(uint numerator, uint denominator)`
* It demonstrates the usage of `require` function
* It takes two unsigned integers `numerator` and `denominator` as the parameter
* It requires the `denominator` to not be equal to `0`
* If it is equal to 0 then it returns an error with the message 'Denominator cannot be zero'
* If it is not equal to 0 then it returns the quotient `numerator/denominator`

## Installation
